# Setting up a JupyterHub on AWS

I teach 1-3 day workshops with 10-40 people and getting all the software working is often a stumbling block and hinders students learning and progress. I am experimenting with using a JupyterHub on AWS to provide a virtual coding platform.

I was inspired by this post by someone who uses a JupyterHub for similar kinds of workshops. https://outpw.github.io/tutorials/JupyterHubSetup.html
Follow the instructions in the link aboveto set up your JupyterHub on AWS. My notes give my experience following the instructions and how I customized my hub.

Cost: The free tier, t2.micro, should be fine for set-up. I think you can leave it on without cost since you get 750 hours per month free. For a recent workshop, where we used t2.small and t2.medium, the cost came out to $100 per day for 65 users. But that was on 2i2c.org. 



## Setting up my JupyterHub

Installing TLJH was easy and worked seamlessly. Setting up my hubâ€¦. Not so much.

### Environment

Next up I wanted to set-up the environment that all users will have access to with all the packages that they will need.
I didn't find any instructions for this so I adapted these instructions by guessing what would work. And I looked at the conda cheetsheet.
https://medium.com/swlh/installing-jupyter-notebook-and-using-your-own-environment-on-mac-fa41efd4639d

Below is what I did. It did NOT work.

I copied `enivronment.yml` from the NASA workshop and put it in a file called `environment_nasa.yml` on my computer. At the top of the file, I changed the name from openscapes to nasahackathon. I created a folder called environments and uploaded the yml file there.

Then I tried to create the environment. I opened up a terminal and issued this command 
```
sudo -E conda env create --file environments/environment_nasa.yml --name nasahackathon
```
This crashed my instance and gave errors about not being able to solve current_repodata.json. But I can create an environment with `conda create -n myenv` and I can install packages and it collects package data from current_repodata.json and solves the environment just fine. It is just the `conda env create` command that doesn't work.

I tried making a super small environment.yml file:
```
name: mini
dependecies:
   - python
```
Nope. I tried putting environment.yml at the base level and running
```
sudo -E conda env create
```
Nope. Failed.

I tried 
```
sudo -E conda create test python=3.9
```
That worked.

I tried creating an yml file by exporting the test environment creating above and using `conda env create -f test.yml`. That failed with the same error about not being able to collect package metadata from current_repodata.json and then it tries repodata.json and hangs...

At this point, I gave up on creating the environment from a file. And just manually installed packages. It took some trial and error to figure out how to install them. For most
```
sudo -E conda install -c conda-forge <packagename>
```
Worked. But for others I needed to use pip
```
sudo -E pip install <packagename>
```
Pip complained about 'sudo' but I wanted packages available at the root level. `sudo pip install <pkg>` (without the -E) seemed to crash the instance.

## Change default to JupyterLab

I followed the instruction here
https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/env/notebook-interfaces.html
To change the default to be JupyterLab UI. 
```
sudo tljh-config set user_environment.default_app jupyterlab
```
Then reboot the instance from the AWS dashboard.

## Add some users

Follow these instruction to add users. It describes adding admin users, but just uncheck the admin box to add regular users. https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/admin/admin-users.html

### Install jupyterlab-git

Login to the JupyterHub (as admin)

Install jupyterlab-git This is a UI to Git for JupyterLab. This installs Git too.
```
sudo conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab-git
```

Set-up the GitHub account for a user (not admin). Logout of admin account and login to a regular user account. Then follow the instructions here https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/clinic/notebooks.html

1. Create a GitHub token for credentials https://github.com/settings/tokens/new. Copy the token because you won't see it again. You'll use it later.

2. Login to the JupyterHub not at admin and open a terminal (in notebook, it is in the top right under 'new').
```
git config --global user.name "eeholmes"
git config --global user.email "eli.holmes@noaa.gov"
```

3. Set up to store credentials
```
git config --global credential.helper store
```

4. Clone a repo (your OWN repo)
```
git clone <github repo url>
```

5. Open the repo (in JupyterLab say) and make a change to a file. Use the Git UI, to commit the change and push. When it asks for credentials, enter GitHub username and the TOKEN
